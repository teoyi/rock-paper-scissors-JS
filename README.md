# rock-paper-scissors-JS
This repo contains the works that I have done for the rock paper scissors game under The Odin Project assignment. 
This site is done with the help of CSS and JavaScript with both frontend and backend completed. 
The site is created such that the user will have to click on their choice of hands to play, and the backend will be in charge of generating random hands played by the computer as well as tallying the score.
